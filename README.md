# EgoDynamic4D Dataset

🚀 **EgoDynamic4D dataset is coming soon.**

This repository hosts the official release of **EgoDynamic4D**, a large-scale egocentric **4D dynamic scene understanding** benchmark introduced in our AAAI 2026 paper:

> **Understanding Dynamic Scenes in Egocentric 4D Point Clouds**

## About the Dataset

**EgoDynamic4D** is a question answering (QA) benchmark designed for fine-grained **spatio-temporal reasoning** in egocentric dynamic scenes.

The dataset includes:

* Egocentric RGB-D videos
* Camera poses
* Globally unique instance masks
* 4D bounding boxes over time
* Large-scale QA annotations for dynamic reasoning tasks

The dataset is constructed based on existing egocentric 4D resources, building upon **ADT and THUD++**. Our main contribution lies in the **large-scale, task-driven QA annotations**, which enable fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic egocentric scenes.

## Open-Source Status

The **EgoDynamic4D dataset is currently being prepared for public release**.

This repository will be updated very soon with:

* Dataset files
* Annotation format and task definitions
* Download and usage instructions

Please stay tuned.
