## About the Dataset

**EgoDynamic4D** is a question answering (QA) benchmark designed for fine-grained **spatio-temporal reasoning** in egocentric dynamic scenes.

The dataset includes:

* Egocentric RGB-D videos
* Camera poses
* Globally unique instance masks
* 4D bounding boxes over time
* Large-scale **QA annotations for dynamic reasoning** tasks

The dataset is constructed based on existing egocentric 4D resources, building upon [ADT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06362) and [THUD++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08096). Our main contribution lies in the **large-scale, task-driven QA annotations**, which enable fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning in dynamic egocentric scenes.
